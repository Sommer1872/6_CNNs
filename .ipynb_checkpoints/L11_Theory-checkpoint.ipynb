    "# Lesson 11: Convolutional Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Filters\n",
    "\n",
    "### Breaking up an Image\n",
    "The first step for a CNN is to break up the image into smaller pieces. We do this by selecting a width and height that defines a filter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The filter looks at small pieces, or patches, of the image. These patches are the same size as the filter.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./screenshots/conv1.png\" width='500'>\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown in the previous video, a CNN uses __filters__ to split an image into smaller __patches__. The size of these patches matches the filter size.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then simply slide this filter horizontally or vertically to focus on a different piece of the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "The amount by which the filter slides is referred to as the __'stride'__. The stride is a hyperparameter which you, the engineer, can tune. Increasing the stride reduces the size of your model by reducing the number of total patches each layer observes. However, this usually comes with a reduction in accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s look at an example. In this zoomed in image of the dog, we first start with the patch outlined in red. The width and height of our filter define the size of this square.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./screenshots/retriever-patch.png\" width='300'>\n",
    "One patch of the Golden Retriever image.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then move the square over to the right by a given stride (2 in this case) to get another patch.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./screenshots/retriever-patch-shifted.png\" width='300'>\n",
    "We move our square to the right by two pixels to create another patch.\n",
    "\n",
    "What's important here is that we are grouping together adjacent pixels and treating them as a collective.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a normal, non-convolutional neural network, we would have ignored this adjacency. In a normal network, we would have connected every pixel in the input image to a neuron in the next layer. In doing so, we would not have taken advantage of the fact that pixels in an image are close together for a reason and have special meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "By taking advantage of this local structure, our CNN learns to classify local patterns, like shapes and objects, in an image.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Filter Depth\n",
    "It's common to have __more than one filter__. Different filters pick up different qualities of a patch. For example, one filter might look for a particular color, while another might look for a kind of object of a specific shape. The amount of filters in a convolutional layer is called the _filter depth_.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./screenshots/neilsen-pic.png\" width='400'>\n",
    "In the above example, a patch is connected to a neuron in the next layer. Source: MIchael Nielsen.\n",
    "\n",
    "How many neurons does each patch connect to?\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s dependent on our filter depth. If we have a depth of __k__, __we connect each patch of pixels to k neurons in the next layer__. This gives us the height of k in the next layer, as shown below. In practice, k is a hyperparameter we tune, and most CNNs tend to pick the same starting values.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./screenshots/filter-depth.png\" width='100'>\n",
    "Choosing a filter depth of `k` connects each patch to `k` neurons in the next layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "But why connect a single patch to multiple neurons in the next layer? Isn’t one neuron good enough?\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple neurons can be useful because a patch can have multiple interesting characteristics that we want to capture.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, one patch might include some white teeth, some blonde whiskers, and part of a red tongue. In that case, we might want a filter depth of at least three - one for each of teeth, whiskers, and tongue.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./screenshots/teeth-whiskers-tongue.png\" width='300'>\n",
    "This patch of the dog has many interesting features we may want to capture. These include the presence of teeth, the presence of whiskers, and the pink color of the tongue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having multiple neurons for a given patch ensures that our CNN can learn to capture whatever characteristics the CNN learns are important.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that the CNN isn't \"programmed\" to look for certain characteristics. Rather, it learns on its own which characteristics to notice."

    "### Parameter Sharing\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./screenshots/convnets.png\" width='400'>\n",
    "\n",
    "The weights, `w`, are shared across patches for a given layer in a CNN to detect the cat above regardless of where in the image it is located.\n",
    "The weights, w, are shared across patches for a given layer in a CNN to detect the cat above regardless of where in the image it is located.\n",
    "When we are trying to classify a picture of a cat, we don’t care where in the image a cat is. If it’s in the top left or the bottom right, it’s still a cat in our eyes. We would like our CNNs to also possess this ability known as translation invariance. How can we achieve this?\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw earlier, the classification of a given patch in an image is determined by the weights and biases corresponding to that patch.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want a cat that’s in the top left patch to be classified in the same way as a cat in the bottom right patch, we need the weights and biases corresponding to those patches to be the same, so that they are classified the same way.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is exactly what we do in CNNs. The weights and biases we learn for a given output layer are shared across all patches in a given input layer. Note that as we increase the depth of our filter, the number of weights and biases we have to learn still increases, as the weights aren't shared across the output channels.\n",
    "\n",
    "There’s an additional benefit to sharing our parameters. If we did not reuse the same weights across all patches, we would have to learn new parameters for every single patch and hidden layer neuron pair. This does not scale well, especially for higher fidelity images. Thus, sharing parameters not only helps us with translation invariance, but also gives us a smaller, more scalable model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Padding\n",

    "\n",
    "A `5x5` grid with a `3x3` filter. Source: Andrej Karpathy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we have a 5x5 grid (as shown above) and a filter of size 3x3 with a stride of 1. What's the width and height of the next layer? We see that we can fit at most three patches in each direction, giving us a dimension of 3x3 in our next layer. As we can see, the width and height of each subsequent layer decreases in such a scheme.\n",
    "\n",
    "In an ideal world, we'd be able to maintain the same width and height across layers so that we can continue to add layers without worrying about the dimensionality shrinking and so that we have consistency. How might we achieve this? One way is to simply add a border of 0s to our original 5x5 image. You can see what this looks like in the below image.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./screenshots/55.png\" width='400'>\n",
    "The same grid with `0` padding. Source: Andrej Karpathy.\n",
    "\n",
    "This would expand our original image to a 7x7. With this, we now see how our next layer's size is again a 5x5, keeping our dimensionality consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dimensionality\n",
    "\n",
    "From what we've learned so far, how can we calculate the number of neurons of each layer in our CNN?\n",
    "\n",
    "Given:\n",
    "\n",
    "- our input layer has a width of W and a height of H\n",
    "- our convolutional layer has a filter size F\n",
    "- we have a stride of S\n",
    "- a padding of P\n",
    "- and the number of filters K,\n",
    "\n",
    "the following formula gives us the __width of the next layer__: $W_{out} = \\frac{(W+2P−width_{filter})}S + 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The __output height__ would be $H_{out} = \\frac{(H+2P−height_{filter})}S + 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "And the __output depth__ would be equal to the number of filters `D_out = K`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The __output volume__ would be `W_out * H_out * D_out`.\n",
    "\n",
